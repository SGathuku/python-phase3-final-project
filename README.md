## Project Description

* The Liquor Store Management System is a command-line application designed to help manage the inventory of a liquor store.
* This simple and user-friendly tool allows users to enter and delete details about liquors, including their names, prices, and categories, and stores this information in an SQLite database for persistent storage.
* The system provides a menu-driven interface where users can easily add new liquor entries and update existing ones. This project is ideal for small liquor store owners or managers who need an efficient way to keep track of their stock.

## Technologies Used

-**Python 3.x**: The main programming language used to develop the application. Python is known for its simplicity and readability, making it a great choice for a command-line application.
-**SQLite3**: A lightweight, disk-based database that doesnâ€™t require a separate server process. SQLite is integrated into the Python standard library, making it easy to use for database operations within a Python application.
-**sqlite3 Python Module**: This module provides a SQL interface compliant with the DB-API 2.0 specification described by PEP 249. It allows the application to connect to an SQLite database, execute SQL queries, and manage data.
-**SQL**: The standard language for relational database management and manipulation. SQL is used within the application to create the database schema and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
